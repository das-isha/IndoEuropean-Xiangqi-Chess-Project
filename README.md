# IndoEuropean-Xiangqi-Chess-Project
For this project I took the Indo-European version of chess that I already created and modified by creating a JavaFX chessboard for the game and creating the classes so that the chess pieces can easily work with either the Java Swing version of the chessboard or the JavaFX version of the chessboard. I also implemented in additional pieces and a new implementation of the board display so that users can choose to play either Indo-European chess or Chinese Xiangqi chess.
