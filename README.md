# IndoEuropean-Xiangqi-Chess-Project
Users can choose to play either Indo-European chess or Chinese Xiangqi chess. This API is compatalible with both the Java Swing version of the chessboard or the JavaFX version of the chessboard. Additionally, I have implemented a testing class and a testing report to demonstrate that all parts of your code behave correctly.
